# VocabVenturer

Simple, text-based CLI adventure game for teaching young children vocabulary in different languages. 

Created for nwHacks 2021 ”HackCamp” Beginner-friendly Hackathon, with a theme of diversity, accessibility, and inclusivity for all.

Created with a team of 3 multicultural students, each of us implementing a language we were fluent with at home.
